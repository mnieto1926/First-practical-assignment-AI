In 2025, the profile of a high-propensity bar coupon user remains defined by frequent visitation habits, social context, and specific demographic traits. Data highlights that situational factors, such as who is in the vehicle, significantly influence redemption rates. 
The purpose of this analysis was to identify the specific demographic and situational factors that influence a driver's decision to accept a mobile bar coupon. By examining data from the "in-vehicle coupon recommendation" dataset, the study aimed to distinguish between likely "accepters" and "non-accepters" to improve marketing precision.
To determine which user traits—such as age, income, and occupation—correlate with higher coupon redemption.
To measure how existing visitation frequency (e.g., visiting a bar more than once a month) dictates future coupon acceptance.
To understand how immediate situational factors, such as the presence of adult passengers versus children, affect the likelihood of stopping at a venue.
To provide actionable insights for businesses to determine when, where, and to whom a coupon should be distributed to maximize conversion and business revenue.
